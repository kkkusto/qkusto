Hi [Manager Name],

As discussed, I wanted to share a consolidated view of the areas I am strong in and confident about:

* AI/ML (LLMs, NLP, Generative AI)
* Python development and automation
* Data engineering on Databricks/Spark/Delta Lake
* Automated data quality and validation frameworks
* JMeter-based performance testing (test creation, automation, and result analysis)
* Backend API development using FastAPI

I am particularly good at building **automation-first solutions** using Python and AI to reduce manual effort and improve efficiency, and I would like to continue growing in applying these skills toward performance testing and intelligent automation.

Happy to discuss further and align with project needs.

Thanks,
Amey Pandit
